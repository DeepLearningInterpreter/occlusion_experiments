The naming of the images is structured as follows:

{name of the image}_{the model used, FRCNN for Faster R-CNN and SSD for SSD}_
{l means that the effect on the localization accuracy is measured, 
c means that the effect on the classification confidence is measured}_
{this number corresponds to the stride}_{this number corresponds to the size of the box}.jpg

So, "image18_SSD_c_0.5_0.1.jpg" corresponds to the heatmap that is the result of an occlusion 
experiment with the following specifications:
image name: 		image18
model:			SSD
decrease in terms of: 	classification confidence
stride:			0.5
size:			0.1
