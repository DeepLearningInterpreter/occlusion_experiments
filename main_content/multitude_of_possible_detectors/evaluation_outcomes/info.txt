To see the evaluation outcomes one needs to use TensorBoard, which can be
launched as follows:

1.  Open the command prompt.
2.  Navigate to "occlusion_experiments\main_content\multitude_of_possible_detectors"
3.  Run the following command:
    tensorboard --logdir="evaluation_outcomes"
4.  Use your browser to navigate to the page indicated in the printing output of
    the command prompt.

You should be able to see the COCO evaluation metrics and some visualized
detections.
